                  <h2 id="campaign-1">Adventure Summary:<br> <span>Waterdeep - Dungeon of The Mad Mage</span></h2>
                 <p>This is a summary for our DND adventure covering some important details/events from when we first began up until now.
                    <br><br>
                  Our story begins with two brave adventurers arriving to a tavern at the foot of mount waterdeep. With a vast cityscape and the swordcoast in the distance, the party met eachother in arguably the most popular adventuring destination in waterdeep. <i>The Yawning Portal.</i> After a brief introduction to the fundamental lore of waterdeep, undermountain and The Mad Mage, the players teamed up with Zodd The Hungry to delve into the mega-dungeon. They fought a variety of creatures including but not limited to goblins, manticores, bugbears, humans, humans disguised as vampires, etc. 
                  <br><br>
                  One day this all changed when the party was ambushed by a group of xanathar members. Most importantly, Zodd entered a room full of enemies unbeknownst to him and was trapped and hung to be an easy target. After he was vanquished by his foes, Benthazar and Gigachez decided to regroup and return to the surface rather than joining zodd in this grizzly fate. He was torn apart while defensless and was pulled deeper into the depths of undermountain, never again to be seen. The party looked to new horizons as the two of them knew they would need morew bodies if they were to brave the dungeon and have a chance to return.
                    <br><br>
                  Enter Fist and Yoroi, two humanoid adventurers that are anything but, have decided to join Benthazar and Gigachez on their campaign into undermountain. Both proved to be worthy allies despite their closely held secret past lives.
                  <br><br> 
                  The jolly adventuring didnt last forever, as another party member fell. Benthazar became victim to an undead beholder zombie. He was simply too far ahead of his freinds and lacked the HP to survive, he was disintegrated by a disintegrating ray, leaving only a juicy puddle of plasmoid remains. His death leaving yet another void in the band of adventurers, and yet another void in gigachez's heart.
                <br><br>
                  Gigachez recovered Benthazar's remains and gave him what he thought to be a proper burial.  
                  <br><br>
                  Garf enters waterdeep. Riding inside of the cart of a travelling trader along with a depressed moaning horse that would talk to him.
                  <br><br>
                  Garf tours the city and enters the market distruct. After a scuttle with some animated armour, he is captured by followers of xanathar and taken into the downshadow. Here he meets gigachez and fights his way out alongside the dwarf, Frederick Drake. While making their escape, they were able to liberate the downshadow town from the xanathar soldiers that occupied it along with <i>Crabdrick the Crabbed</i>("crab-bbed") .After connecting with the firends of his master, garf and homies decide to continue their journey into undermountain as a party.
                  <br><br>
                  Clive leaves his home within the feywild to seek adventure in the material plane. He quikcly find hismelf walking along the northeast road into waterdeep.
                  <br><br>
                  Clive encounters an ambushed carriage along the road. The only survivor was a woman who pointed out a newborn baby and then immediately perished to her injuries. Clive decides to take the baby.
                  <br><br>
                  After saving a baby and defeating kobolds, clive enters the city through one of its eastern gates, which had a steep entrance fee.
                  <br><br>
                  Clive delivers the baby to an orphanage so that it may have a future. 
                  <br><br>
                  The adventuring party is introduced to clive at the yawning portal, however introductions are short when the yawning portal is attacked by a small crew of elite assassins.
                  <br><br>
                  The yawning portal immediately changed as the tavern was magically transformed into an infinte dance floor, in which the patrons of the tavern were forced to dance against their will.
                  <br><br>
                  The assailants each had mysterious powers allowing them to attack their foes from afar, some a bit more complex than others. 
                  <br><br>
                  Clive(Goated) was able to locate the source of spacial magic due to the sheer volume of music in proximity to his foe. Clive broke his nose and burned his clothes with a firebolt, causing the <i>illusion</i> to dissipate 
                  <br><br>
                  The leader of the attacking group conjured an enormous firearm and caused a fiery explosion right behind garf that claimed the lives of everyone immediately next to it, leaving a bloody hazy mist of blood in the air, covering garf. The assailants take this moment to make their exit as they have met their goal. Shadow-like sillhoettes dart out of the crowd and dive into the yawning portal well hole, escaping mostly in tact.
                  <br><br>
                  <i>"Jack the hater"</i> was caught in this explosion, losing his right arm and parts of his shoulder shredded. Clive offered to help him with healing magic, tossing his missing arm at him after being insulted.
                  <br><br>
                  After their assistance, Durnan offers the party the old adventuring suite on the second floor of the yawning portal. <i>Mother Base</i> is established as a bastion.
                  <br><br>
                  Jorf, a friend of the party, offers to play a management/logistical role in their efforts. Jorf wil ltake care of motherbase and offer improvements to be made based on their needs and his available connections. Jorf gives gigachez a <i>magical communication device</i>(Pager)
                  <br><br>
                  BREAKING NEWS: The Great Crusade | Waterdeep Lords Sanction Crusade of Undermountain, Led by Knightly Orders to "Tear out the treachery below"
                  <br><br>
                  The yawning portal is full of different patrons, the 6 knightly orders of waterdeep have gathered to descend into undermountain. Entrance into undermountain is prohibited to individuals without licensure.
                  <br><br>
                  Durnan is distasteful towards knightly orders, so he recommends your party to gain licensure for descent into the dungeon. With this and indirect influence of lady silverhand, this is granted.
                  <br><br>
                  The party is introduced to the sable wardens. Put simply they are assholes and dont reveal too much about their mission. THe knights seem resilient and were encountered slahing down a crowd of goblins before something more sinister showed its face.
                  <br><br>
                  Garf, Gigachez and Clive enter undermountain level 1, encountering and destroying a group of undead attempting to complete a ritual. After their success, a shadowy figure or sillhoete stretches out of the room and moves down the southern corridor. The individual looks like a skeleton with both hands holding up middle fingers. Like a silent wind you can hear past by, "Fuck Xanathar" echoes in the dungeon before the sound and figure dissipates.
                  <br><br>
                  After exploring through to level 3, the party chooses to pass by a large multi-headed creature. Instead they find themselves in <i>Drowtown</i> where they are pushed to their limits by drow archers, swordsman and giant spiders.
                  <br><br>
                  Here the party is defeated. Their last memories of themselves being dragged in the darkness past inflated bodies and corpses that were used to incubate the eggs of spiders. The drow stop for a moment and knock you out with a swift blow to the head.
                  <br><br>
                    The end? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

                  <h2 id="campaign-2">Adventure Summary:<br> <span>Wyllowswood - Spellplague</span></h2>
                  <p>This is a summary for our DND adventure covering some important details/events from when we first began Wyllowswood - Spellplague.
                    <br><br>
                  <strong style="color:goldenrod">The year is 1385DR, and the spellplague is in full effect.</strong> <strong style="color:red">Magic is broken, and with it, reality itself.</strong> The very planes of existance are subject to change and collide at the behest of the ultimate apocolypse brought upon by the hubris and greed of mortals and gods.
                  <br><br>
                  A new trio emerges to battle against the blue breath of change while they navigate undermountain in search of magical artifacts and riches. Momon, Alea Spice & Jolyne Jaren await their mission briefing in the cargo hold of a ship.
                  <br><br>
                  Party is introduced to Trout & Peto. Trout is a caucus human rogue with long black hair wrapped in dark leathers, it's clear that he is blind however he talks as if he can "see" his surroundings. Peto is a bulkier dark skinned human with dark brown hair and a bushy mustache with twisted ends. His "occupation" isnt fully clear, however he has been seen with a curved saber at his waist and an almost inhuman sillhoette. His arms and especially his shoulders/biceps almost seem to stretch beneath his skin as if his muscles are artifically bulked.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Trout & Peto Impart Mission Details:</strong>
                <br>
                - All of reality itself is colliding and tearing itself apart, this is quite literally the apocalypse of <i>the forgotten realms</i>
                <br>
                - The spellplague physically manifests itself as magical blue flames. Hence the nickname <strong style="color:cyan"><i>The Blue Flame of Change</i></strong>
                 <br>
                  - The spellplague does not only affect the enviornment as it closely resembles an <i>ailment</i> of the weave itself. Something aint right, so <span style="color:cyan"><strong>any magic you cast may not work at all, <span style="color:red">or worse, magic in any capacity can be very unpredictable</strong></span></span>
                 <br>
                - This mission was ordered and sponsored by one of the <i>Lords of Waterdeep</i>, your mission is to capture any and all magical artifacts & items of value(loot the damn place)
                <br>
                - We will enter undermountain via a hidden cave entrance on the surface, from there we will delve to <i>Level 5: Wyllowswood</i>
                <br><br>
                Together with peto and trout, the party makes it to the poop deck of the small ship to be greeted with a scene of pure carniage.
                <br><br>
                Stormy lightning clouds, pouring rain, giant waves crashing against the barrier wall of the waterdavian cove. In the city there are towering stone giants rampaging through the city streets. Dragons in the sky are scorching the heavens and clawing out eachothers hearts while ensuring destruction of those below. You can see floating buildings and sections of land rising up wreathed in the signauture spellplague blue flame.
                <br><br>
                The corners of your vision betray you as you approach the city, portions of other realities and places starting to materialize in the material plane while the land around you burns and fades away slowly with each breath.
