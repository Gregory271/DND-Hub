                  <h2>Adventure Summary:<br> Waterdeep - Dungeon of The Mad Mage</h2>
                  <p>This is a summary for our DND adventure covering some important details/events from when we first began up until now.
                    <br><br>
                  Our story begins with two brave adventurers arriving to a tavern at the foot of mount waterdeep. With a vast cityscape and the swordcoast in the distance, the party met eachother in arguably the most popular adventuring destination in waterdeep. <i>The Yawning Portal.</i> After a brief introduction to the fundamental lore of waterdeep, undermountain and The Mad Mage, the players teamed up with Zodd The Hungry to delve into the mega-dungeon. They fought a variety of creatures including but not limited to goblins, manticores, bugbears, humans, humans disguised as vampires, etc. 
                  <br><br>
                  One day this all changed when the party was ambushed by a group of xanathar members. Most importantly, Zodd entered a room full of enemies unbeknownst to him and was trapped and hung to be an easy target. After he was vanquished by his foes, Benthazar and Gigachez decided to regroup and return to the surface rather than joining zodd in this grizzly fate. He was torn apart while defensless and was pulled deeper into the depths of undermountain, never again to be seen. The party looked to new horizons as the two of them knew they would need morew bodies if they were to brave the dungeon and have a chance to return.
                    <br><br>
                  Enter Fist and Yoroi, two humanoid adventurers that are anything but, have decided to join Benthazar and Gigachez on their campaign into undermountain. Both proved to be worthy allies despite their closely held secret past lives.
                  <br><br> 
                  The jolly adventuring didnt last forever, as another party member fell. Benthazar became victim to an undead beholder zombie. He was simply too far ahead of his freinds and lacked the HP to survive, he was disintegrated by a disintegrating ray, leaving only a juicy puddle of plasmoid remains. His death leaving yet another void in the band of adventurers, and yet another void in gigachez's heart.
                <br><br>
                  Gigachez recovered Benthazar's remains and gave him what he thought to be a proper burial.  
                </p>
