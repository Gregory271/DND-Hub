            <li>She would prefer that you quickly pass through the forest into the depths below, for those who seek treasure typically seek to harm the denizens of the woods. </li>

            <li>The Adolescent Green Dragon. Order's from a lord dictate that your team is to locate and procure magical artifacts and treasure, particularly any treasure that originated as part of the dragon's hoard. </li>
            <li style="color:goldenrod">Whoever it was that sent you on this mission has allowed you the freedom of operating on your own terms. Annhilation of the green dragon Valdemar is optional. Wyllow however does not sanction violence even against such a beast. 
</li>
            <li>Confronting you atop the cabin next to the pikmin village, this serpent has hinted that magic users are partly to blame for the spellplague. Even trying to guilt your party into instead returning magic artifacts and lost treasure to his hoard atop the northern mountains. Only once you've "returned" enough treasure will he have audience with you again. Oh and leave your weapons at the door. (Its an ancient dragon cultural custom)
